abstract: We prove that the infinitely generated Apollonian gasket has full Hausdorff dimension spectrum. Our proof, which is computer assisted, relies on an iterative technique introduced by the first three authors in [3] and on a flexible method for rigorously estimating Hausdorff dimensions of limit sets of conformal iterated function systems, which we recently developed in [5]. Another key ingredient in our proof is obtaining reasonably sized distortion constants for the (infinite) Apollonian iterated function system. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

This work is driven by the results in my [previous paper](/publication/preprint/) on rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for conformal fractals.
