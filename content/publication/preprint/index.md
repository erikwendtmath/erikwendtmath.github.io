abstract: We develop a versatile framework which allows us to rigorously estimate the Hausdorff dimension of maximal conformal graph directed Markov systems in {{<math>}}$\mathbb{R}^n${{</math>}} for {{<math>}}$n \geq 2${{</math>}}. Our method is based on piecewise linear approximations of the eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator via a finite element framework for discretization and iterative mesh schemes. One key element in our approach is obtaining bounds for the derivatives of these  eigenfunctions, which,  besides being essential for the implementation of our method, are of independent interest.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper develops both theory and algorithms for Hausdorff dimension estimation on conformal fractals.
