abstract: We exhibit a scalar-valued state-dependent delay differential equation {{<math>}}$$x′(t)=f(x(t−d(xt)))$${{</math>}} that has a chaotic solution. This equation has continuous (semi-strictly) monotonic negative feedback, and the quantity {{<math>}}$t−d(xt)${{</math>}} is strictly increasing along solutions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we discovered the first example of chaotic solutions to differential delay equations.
