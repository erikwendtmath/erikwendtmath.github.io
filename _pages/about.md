Hi, my name is Erik! I'm a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [University of Connecticut.](https://math.uconn.edu/) My main research interests are in measurable dynamical systems, with a specific focus on rigorous dimension estimates. Outside of research, I am the current president of the graduate student chapter of [SIAM](https://siam.math.uconn.edu/) at UConn.
